    <p> Calcifer from 
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/" target="_blank"><cite>Howl's Moving Castle</cite></a>
        is Howl's resident fire demon. As the result of a mysterious bargain with Howl some 
        years ago he agrees to heat and power the castle. Although he is bound to the earth he has a great amount of magic. 
        He promises to use his magic to break the curse on Sophie, providing she breaks the contract between him and Howl. 
        Howl describes Calcifer as "his weakest point", because Calcifer wouldn't give away another demon if it entered the 
        castle, even if it had hostile intentions. However Howl's statement is true in more ways than one.
